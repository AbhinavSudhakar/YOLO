The image capture code using webcam is specific to Google collaboratory.
To implement the code, we need to download three files: yolov3.cfg, yolov3.weights and coco.names.
The coco.names file is uploaded in the repository.
To download yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights, download the files under YOLOv3-320 at https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
